# Multi-UAV Edge Computing Task Offloading
## 6-Minute Video Presentation Script

### PART 1: INTRODUCTION (1 minute)
---------------------------------

**Slide 1: Title**
- Hello everyone, today I'm presenting our research project on "Deep Learning-Based Task Offloading in Multi-UAV Edge Computing."
- This project implements a novel approach to optimize computation offloading in IoT environments using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as mobile edge servers.

**Slide 2: Problem Statement**
- IoT devices are often resource-constrained with limited processing power, memory, and battery life.
- Edge computing brings computation closer to data sources, but fixed edge servers have limited coverage.
- UAVs offer mobility and flexibility as flying edge servers but require intelligent task offloading strategies.
- The key challenge: How to make optimal offloading decisions that minimize energy consumption and latency while meeting task deadlines?

### PART 2: RESEARCH FOUNDATION (1 minute)
-------------------------------------

**Slide 3: Research Paper**
- Our implementation is based on the 2022 IEEE research paper: "A Deep Learning Approach for Task Offloading in Multi-UAV Aided Mobile Edge Computing"
- The paper proposes a deep neural network approach to make dynamic offloading decisions based on system state.

**Slide 4: Key Innovations**
- Traditional offloading algorithms rely on heuristics or simple thresholds.
- Our deep learning approach captures complex relationships between:
  * Task characteristics (computation requirements, data size, deadlines)
  * Device states (battery level, processing capability)
  * UAV conditions (position, workload, energy)
  * Network conditions (bandwidth, latency)
- The system learns optimal policies through experience rather than explicit programming.

### PART 3: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (1.5 minutes)
--------------------------------------

**Slide 5: Three-Tier Architecture**
- Our system implements a three-tier architecture:
  1. IoT Layer: Edge devices generating computation tasks
  2. UAV-MEC Layer: Multiple UAVs with edge computing capabilities
  3. Cloud Layer: Backend cloud resources (not fully implemented in this prototype)

**Slide 6: System Components**
- Key components include:
  * IoT Device Module: Simulates devices generating varied computational tasks
  * UAV Module: Models aerial edge servers with mobility patterns
  * Task Generation Engine: Creates realistic task workloads
  * Network Simulation: Models wireless communication with path loss
  * Deep Learning Controller: Makes offloading decisions
  * Metrics Collection: Gathers performance data on energy, latency, etc.

**Slide 7: Offloading Process Flow**
- When a task is generated, the system:
  1. Extracts features from the current state (device, UAVs, task)
  2. Inputs these features into the trained neural network
  3. The network outputs a decision (local execution or specific UAV)
  4. The task is executed according to this decision
  5. Performance metrics are collected for evaluation

### PART 4: IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS (1 minute)
----------------------------------------

**Slide 8: Technology Stack**
- Java with JDK 11 for core implementation
- CloudSim Plus for simulation framework
- DeepLearning4J for neural network implementation
- Maven for dependency management
- JFreeChart for visualization components

**Slide 9: Deep Learning Model**
- We implemented a feedforward neural network with:
  * Input layer: Features representing system state
  * Hidden layers: Multiple fully-connected layers with ReLU activation
  * Output layer: Softmax activation for decision probabilities
- The model was trained using simulation data with rewards based on energy efficiency and task completion times.

### PART 5: RESULTS AND ANALYSIS (1 minute)
--------------------------------------

**Slide 10: Performance Metrics**
- Our evaluation focuses on key metrics:
  * Task completion rates (100% in optimized system)
  * Deadline satisfaction (>99%)
  * Energy consumption (reduced by ~30% compared to baseline)
  * Average latency (improved by ~25%)
  * Resource utilization across UAVs

**Slide 11: Comparative Analysis**
- We compared our deep learning approach against:
  * Local execution only (high energy consumption for devices)
  * Random assignment (poor load balancing)
  * Nearest UAV strategy (doesn't consider UAV workload)
- Our approach consistently outperformed these baselines in terms of energy efficiency and task completion times.

### PART 6: CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK (0.5 minutes)
----------------------------------------------

**Slide 12: Conclusions**
- We successfully implemented a deep learning-based task offloading system for UAV-aided edge computing.
- The system demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency and task completion times.
- The approach is adaptable to changing environmental conditions.

**Slide 13: Future Work**

  * Implementation of more sophisticated mobility models
  * Integration with real-world UAV platforms
  * Incorporation of security and privacy considerations
  * Multi-objective optimization for conflicting goals
